## Overview

This example demonstrates how to use the SIMT remote memory access (RMA) APIs in SIMD and SIMT hybrid compilation mode. These APIs mainly come in the following three forms:

1. `__simt_callee__ inline void aclshmem_{NAME}_{op}(__gm__ TYPE *dst, __gm__ TYPE *src, size_t elem_size, int32_t pe)`
2. `__simt_callee__ inline void aclshmem_{op}{BITS}(__gm__ void *dst, __gm__ void *src, size_t nelems, int32_t pe)`
3. `__simt_callee__ inline void aclshmem_{op}mem(__gm__ void *dst, __gm__ void *src, size_t elem_size, int32_t pe)`

The core function of all three forms is to transfer data over a contiguous memory region. They differ in how the data length is specified:

- **The first form**: Specifies the length based on the concrete data type of each transferred element (such as `half`, `float`, and so on).
- **The second form**: Specifies the length based on the bit width of each transferred element (such as `8`, `16`, and so on).
- **The third form**: Directly specifies the total number of bytes to transfer.

Each form additionally comes in 3 thread-group variants, which differ in the range of threads that participate in the transfer:

| Variant | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `aclshmem_*` (no suffix) | Thread level. The calling thread transfers the whole region on its own. |
| `aclshmemx_*_block` | Block level. Threads within the same block cooperate on the transfer. |
| `aclshmemx_*_warp` | Warp level. Threads within the same warp (32 threads) cooperate on the transfer. |

**This example calls the warp-level variants.** The kernel is launched with `dim3(32)`, so the 32 threads of a warp cooperate to move one copy of the data, rather than each thread independently traversing the whole region. The APIs actually called for each of the three forms are:

```cpp
// Form 1: length described by the element data type
simt::aclshmemx_int16_get_warp(__gm__ int16_t *dst, __gm__ int16_t *src, size_t elem_size, int32_t pe);
simt::aclshmemx_int16_put_warp(__gm__ int16_t *dst, __gm__ int16_t *src, size_t elem_size, int32_t pe);
// Form 2: length described by the element bit width
simt::aclshmemx_get128_warp(__gm__ void *dst, __gm__ void *src, size_t nelems, int32_t pe);
simt::aclshmemx_put128_warp(__gm__ void *dst, __gm__ void *src, size_t nelems, int32_t pe);
// Form 3: total number of bytes specified directly
simt::aclshmemx_getmem_warp(__gm__ void *dst, __gm__ void *src, size_t elem_size, int32_t pe);
simt::aclshmemx_putmem_warp(__gm__ void *dst, __gm__ void *src, size_t elem_size, int32_t pe);
```

The following table lists the allowed values of the placeholders `{}` in the API names.

| Placeholder | Allowed Values |
| --- | --- |
| `{op}` | `put`, `get` |
| `{NAME}` | `half`, `float`, `int8`, `int16`, `int32`, `int64`, `uint8`, `uint16`, `uint32`, `uint64`, `char`, and `bfloat16` |
| `{BITS}` | `8`, `16`, `32`, `64`, `128` |

### Sample Execution Process

This example demonstrates how the RMA APIs work through the following process:

1. **Environment initialization**: Each compute unit (PE) initializes 3 symmetric memory blocks of the same size. The first block is initialized to `[my_pe + 0, ..., my_pe + size - 1]`, while the second and third blocks are initialized to `-1`.
2. **GET operation demonstration**: Each PE calls the `get` API (warp-level variant) to pull data from the first memory block of the **previous PE** (in logical order) and write it into its own second memory block.
3. **PUT operation demonstration**: Each PE calls the `put` API (warp-level variant) to push data from its own first memory block to the third memory block of the **previous PE**. The target is the previous PE because, from its point of view, the current PE is its "next PE" — this way each PE's third block ends up holding the data of its own next PE.
4. **Result verification**: After the communication operations complete, each PE automatically compares the data in memory to verify the correctness of the data transfer — the second block must equal the previous PE's first block, and the third block must equal the next PE's first block.

> The sample code provides three functions — `test_put_get_type`, `test_put_get_bits`, and `test_put_get_mem` — corresponding to the three API forms above. `test_put_get_bits` is called by default; switch to another as needed.

## Supported Devices

- Ascend 950

## Instructions

1. **Compile the project.**
   Run the compilation script in the root directory of SHMEM.

   ```bash
   bash scripts/build.sh -examples -enable_simt -soc_type Ascend950
   ```

2. **Run the simt_rma sample program.**
   Go to the example directory and run the execution script.

   ```bash
   cd examples/simt_rma
   bash run.sh
   ```

   By default, `run.sh` launches 2 independent processes, each corresponding to one PE bound to one device, and runs the sample using `build/bin/simt_rma`. Use the `-pes` option to specify the number of PEs (devices) to run with, for example, to run with 4 devices:

   ```bash
   bash run.sh -pes 4
   ```

   When running with multiple devices, make sure the number of NPU devices actually available in the environment is not less than the specified number of PEs.
