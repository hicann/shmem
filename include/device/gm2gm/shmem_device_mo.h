 * @brief The aclshmem_quiet routine ensures completion of all operations on symmetric data objects issued by the

 *        both scale-up network HCCS and scale-out network (RDMA), ACLSHMEM only guarantees that updates to the
 *        memory of a given PE are visible to that PE.
 *        Quiet operations issued on the CPU and the NPU only complete communication operations that were
 *        issued from the CPU and the NPU, respectively. To ensure completion of GPU-side operations from
