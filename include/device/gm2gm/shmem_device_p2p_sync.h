 * @param sig_addr              [in] Local address of the source signal variable.
 * @param cmp                   [in] The comparison operator that compares sig_addr with cmp_val. Supported operators:
 *                                   ACLSHMEM_CMP_EQ/ACLSHMEM_CMP_NE/ACLSHMEM_CMP_GT/ACLSHMEM_CMP_GE/ACLSHMEM_CMP_LT/ACLSHMEM_CMP_LE.
 * @param cmp_val               [in] The value against which the object pointed to by sig_addr will be compared.
 * @return Return the contents of the signal data object, sig_addr, at the calling PE that satisfies the wait condition.
