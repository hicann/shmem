/*
    WARNING：Restrictions of Barrier APIs.

    1. Barrier APIs can be used only in MIX kernels. The compiler will optimize the kernel to VEC or CUBE if
       it lacks effective cube instructions (eg. Mmad) or vector instructions (eg: DataCopy).
    Need compiler updates to remove this feature, or insert Mmad/DataCopy calls manully.

    2. Barrier APIs conflict with SyncAll. Avoid mixing them together.

    3. We provide 2 kinds of barrier:
        a. aclshmem_barrier_xxx
            Barrier of all cores. On systems with only HCCS: All operations of all pes of a team on excuting
            stream before the barrier are visiable to all pes of the team after the barrier.
        b. aclshmemx_barrier_xxx_vec
            Barrier of all VEC cores. On systems with only HCCS: All operations of ALL VEC CORES of all pes of a
            team on excuting stream before the barrier are visiable to ALL VEC CORES of all pes of the team after
            the barrier.

    4. The scalar unit of cube core is not affected by aclshmem_barrier_xxx. Make sure don't use that.

 * @brief aclshmem_barrier is a collective synchronization routine over a team. Control returns from aclshmem_barrier

 *        from the CPU and the NPU, respectively. To ensure completion of GPU-side operations from the CPU, using
