 * QP-specific aggregate operations are supported only on XSCALE.
 * - A batch contains deferred operations followed by exactly one submit operation. The submit operation publishes the
 *   complete batch and resets its state after success.
 * - A batch must use one operation kind, PE, QP index, submit state, UB workspace base, and synchronization ID.
 * - The total number of operations, including the submit operation, must not exceed
 *   @ref ACLSHMEM_ROCE_QP_AGGREGATE_MAX_OPS. Split larger work into multiple batches.
 * - The UB workspace capacity must be at least `64 + 128 * n` bytes, where n is the total batch size.
 * - Different QP indices may concurrently access the same PE when each execution unit owns its QP index, submit state,
 *   and UB workspace. A single `(pe, qp_idx)` supports one producer and one active batch at a time.
 * - After submit, call @ref aclshmemx_roce_qp_quiet before consuming Get destinations, reusing Put sources, or
 *   reusing the batch workspace.
