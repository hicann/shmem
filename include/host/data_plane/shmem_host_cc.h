/**
 * @fn ACLSHMEM_HOST_API void aclshmem_barrier(aclshmem_team_t team)
 * @brief aclshmem_barrier is a collective synchronization routine over a team. Control returns from aclshmem_barrier
 *        after all PEs in the team have called aclshmem_barrier.
 *        aclshmem_barrier ensures that all previously issued stores and remote memory updates, including AMOs and
 *        RMA operations, done by any of the PEs in the active set are complete before returning. On systems with
 *        only scale-up network (HCCS), updates are globally visible, whereas on systems with both scale-up network
 *        HCCS and scale-out network (RDMA), ACLSHMEM only guarantees that updates to the memory of a given PE are
 *        visible to that PE.
 *        Barrier operations issued on the CPU and the NPU only complete communication operations that were issued
 *        from the CPU and the NPU, respectively. To ensure completion of GPU-side operations from the CPU, using
 *        aclrtSynchronizeStream/aclrtDeviceSynchronize or stream-based API.
